One Piece‚úñÔ∏èLabubu‚Äôs joint brand is here. The feel I shared today is Luffy. Students, please read the feelings first. Please collect them and pay attention! Sharing the feel: Weight 87.7g, 88.3g, 89.6 (the weight of the light echelon is not unique) Up and down: The space is large and about one to one and a half fingers, because it is a squatted baby. 	 Front and back: It is more flexible and the middle and lower parts are boxed, sometimes on the front and sometimes on the back, flexible. But be careful whether the middle and upper parts are boxed. 	 Left and right: You can feel the baby and accessories shaking, but it is not nearly as full as the box is not. 	 Summary: There is a lot of space for the upper and lower echelons, and there are middle and lower parts on all sides. It may be possible to make boxes on both sides of 1-3. There must be one opposite side in front, back, left and right, and the other opposite side is relatively flexible. Okay, I wish all students can draw cospley's labubu!

ÔøΩToday's sharing: It's also the first time I bought the One Piece series. I didn't expect that there were two Luffys on the table and one Zoro didn't turn it in one go. The first Luffy, the second one, wanted to shake Zoro and overturn Luffy, and the third one, the third one, hahaha üëë Luffy: Weight: 94g and 97g are heavy. Among the full set of blind boxes, Zoro has the lightest one, the lightest one is Zoro. Nami and Robin are only two models that are prone to overturn based on weight. Shake the box: My baby is putting it upside down, so you have to turn the box backwards, shake it all the way up and down, ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏èCalling the half finger space, you can hear the sound of the accessories smashing the box and the middle packing of desiccant. The accessories penetrate up and down, and the boxing point is punched (Figure 2, Figure 3). Left and left‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏èThe space for the shake box should be larger than the space for the front and back, and the boxing point is in the middle of Nami and Chopper in the picture book, and the same position on the other side. The whole thing is shaking, and the sound is loud inside. The accessories are desiccant and the baby's head. ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èThe countertop must be irritable. It is easy to overturn the weight. The box around Robin is very flexible. The upper and lower space of Nami is relatively high and slightly heavier. üëëZoro: Weight: 88g, the lightest in the whole series. Shake box: The maximum up and down space is about two fingers. The upper and lower space is obvious. The front, back, left and right box is flexible. The six-sided box is in the same position on the cover Luffy's hair. Personally, Luffy and Zoro feel similar because I just overturn the Luffy according to Zoro's feel‚Äº Ô∏èSummary‚Äº Ô∏è: Light, the sound of the shaking box is loud, the space is large, the box is right, the touch is right, üéâüéâüéâüéâ Share the feel here, I wish everyone can realize their dreams.

Those who choose light large desiccant, both boxes are 94g, which is considered light in the entire series. However, because Luffy's net weight is only about 84, even a weight of 94 is as light as Luffy, it needs to be equipped with about 10 grams of desiccant, which can be said to be a big bag. If you increase the desiccant below 95, you will basically lock the range in Zoro, Robin, and Luffy. Zoro is generally lighter, at 90 or even below. Zoro is also a hot model, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about it, mainly excluding Robin. The difference between Robin and Luffy is that Luffy is stretched out his hands, the surroundings will be wider, the distance between the box will be shorter, and the box will be printed on both sides at the same time. Robin is very thin, like a stick, with a larger space around it. If it is placed obliquely, it may be full, but there will be no box points on both sides at the same height at the same time, so it can be judged. 
Only the end box knows that hiding will only replace the basic Luffy. The weight of the whole end: 1440g. Feeling: 100g. Only slightly touching left and right (space is ignored) cannot shake up and down. There is a creaking sound on the front and back Luffy's face. The only feel is that there is still room for the lie cloth up and down. 
The hidden five-speed Nika Luffy feel of the Rabbu X King of Navigation series: The net weight of desiccant is 94 grams, so the weight is about 97-105 grams. The light hand is full. The most core point is also the key to pulling this hidden, which is the full upper and lower, which is basically impossible to shake. The rest of the things that don‚Äôt top are useless. Where is love, it‚Äôs also his. If you don‚Äôt top it, it‚Äôs his. I understand?

Labubu's joint name One Piece can be said to be ecstatic for the two chefs, and the three popular models of the joint series Luffy, Chopper and Zorro are all Ming boxes, so it's not difficult. 	 üëëLuffy: The weight belongs to the light echelon, and only chooses from the lightest boxes. The upper and lower half refer to the space, which can be shaken both front, back, left and right, and the left and right space is significantly larger than the front and back. It has a clear feeling of touching the box when it shakes left and right, and there is only one side of the box that touches the box clearly at the bottom. (The touch box point is shown in Figure 2). A very important point is that there is a large bag of desiccant, and the sound is obvious. 	 üëëChoba: The weight is the heaviest in the entire series, and it feels obvious when you get it. The upper and lower half refer to the space, and the overall size is full, and it cannot shake left and right. There are very obvious hard tops in front and back. When placed in front and back, the front and back middle and upper top boxes are placed in reverse. When placed in front and back, the front and back middle and lower top boxes are not on the left and right but there is a sense of obstruction. 	 üëëZorro The weight is the lightest in the entire series.  The upper and lower half refer to the space, which can be shaken both front, back, left and right, and the left and right space is significantly larger than the front and back. The middle part of the left and right shake box is obviously touching the box (the point of the box is shown in Figure 3). Accessories are boxed up and down the cover. 	 In general, the three popular models of the Labubu One Piece series are quite obvious. As long as you learn the strategy, you can get it right, and everyone can draw the central wish model!

It's so rare that I actually met the one Piece Labubu co-branded model on the table. This is the first time I met it. I thought it would be good to have a Zoro, but if I have the goods, I still couldn't help but have a Luffy. First of all, you have to find the lightest one on the table and then combine the feel. "Zoro" 89.01g. Everyone always thinks it's a sitting baby, so there's a large space on the top of the bottom. In fact, there's only half a finger on the top of the cover. The cover ear will hit the box. See Picture 5 for details. See Picture 6 for details. Use these points to easily buy the "Chorba" 137.7g series is the heaviest, and the left and right top boxes are very obvious. Later, after paying the order, I found that it will hit the front and back. It's because of its big head‚Äº Ô∏è Tell me about "Luffy" 97.21g, I almost gave up. It was heavier than the "Zoro" in my hand. I put it back for a while. Later, according to the box position, I came here. I didn't expect it to be like this. It's still quite flexible on the left and right. Next is the listening question. Under the same weight, if the sound is too messy, it's "Nami". If the space on the left and right is relatively large, it's "Robin" and "Luffy" have one and a half fingers on the upper and lower spaces. However, the cover touch box is under the ear. The location of the face touch box is between "Brook" and "Robin". See the picture 4 for details. I wish everyone can draw their favorite wish model ‚ù§Ô∏è

Calm and chubby, green and high-end, but my face is relatively white, and I have slightly reduced the score, otherwise I will be named alone. 3Ô∏è‚É£Hope (blue)üü∞Happy (orange): Tie dye is not particularly obvious, blue and orange are also beautiful. 	 6Ô∏è‚É£Loyalty (fluorescent powder): The face is super dark... After hanging it up, it seems to be getting better. ‚ú®Summary: When it comes to the problem of dark face, it actually doesn‚Äôt. However, different colors of treasures have real appearance, black and white. „äóÔ∏è Everyone‚Äôs wish has come true! ~ .0

For the sake of the fifth-level Luffy, I really put together everything, I delivered the mini program to my home, and bought it if I got the box and got it. I have never bought it in my store anyway. Yesterday, Xuzhou restocked the goods and bought another 4 ends. The last try was the weight of the whole end 1412, 1417, 1422, 1429. Nothing happened after demolishing 1412, but demolishing 1417 finally came! Weight: 99.2 grams. Feeling: It can shake up and down, less than half a finger of space. Move slightly forward and backward, shake left and right, and put on a box without accessories. The picture of the mountain wisdom has a top, and the opposite side also has a top, which is inverted. Finally graduated, and I will never buy Neptune again
